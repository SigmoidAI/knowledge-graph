>ðŸ“˜ **INFO**
>This is a project that was started from an **idea** about having every tech information that you might need in one single place available for everyone to use and add to it, basically a **knowledge-graph** for the tech industry.

The first iteration of the **knowledge-graph** will start with the python programming language and lean towards Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence related stuff, but there are no limitations therefore the sky is the limit.

> This project was started by Eduard Balamatiuc on October 23 2023, at that time he was the CTO of Sigmoid.
